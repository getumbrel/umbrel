The homeserver stores all their personal chat history and user account information - much as a mail client connects through to an IMAP/SMTP server. Just like email, you can either run your own Matrix homeserver and control and own your own communications and history or use one hosted by someone else (e.g. matrix.org) - there is no single point of control or mandatory service provider in Matrix, unlike WhatsApp, Facebook, Hangouts, etc.",

        "description": "ItchySats enables peer-2-peer CFD trading on Bitcoin using DLCs (discreet log contracts). No account needed, no trusted third-party - just you and your keys.\n\nThis is beta software. We tested it on test- and mainnet, but there are no guarantees that it will always behave as expected.\nPlease be mindful with how much money you trust the application with.\nCFDs trading is inherently risky, be sure to read up on it before using this application.\n\nThat said: This is pretty awesome, go nuts!\n\n1. Fund the ItchySats wallet\n2. Open a position\n3. Watch the price go up\n4. Profit\n\nLimitations of the mainnet beta:\n\n1. You can only open long positions at the moment\n2. Minimum position quantity is $100, maximum $1000\n3. The leverage is fixed at 2\n\nWith 0.4.0 your CFDs are perpetual positions that are extended hourly. This means your CFD position will remain open forever unless you decide to close it. A funding fee is collected hourly when the CFD is extended.\nUpdate for going short to be expected soon!",
