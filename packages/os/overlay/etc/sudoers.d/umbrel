# Remove the silly outdated warning from sudo the first time it's used:
#
# We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
# Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:
#
#     #1) Respect the privacy of others.
#     #2) Think before you type.
#     #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
