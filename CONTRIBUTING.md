## How to contribute to this project

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/lncm/thebox-compose-system/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/lncm/thebox-compose-system/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and try to include a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* If you haven't done a test build yet, please mention this in the pull request. This will save a world of pain for future builds. There is no regression testing suite set up yet but this is something that we're looking into. Contributions are welcome.
