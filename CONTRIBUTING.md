Contributing to Umbrel
======================

Umbrel is an open project and we love to receive contributions from our community! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Umbrel itself.

Bug reports
-----------

If you think you have found a bug in Umbrel, first make sure that you are on the [latest version of Umbrel](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel/releases/latest) because your issue may already have been fixed. If not, search our [issues list](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel/issues) on GitHub in case a similar issue has already been opened.

If there's no existing issue, please open a new issue and provide us as much information about the bug as you can. It would be very helpful if you can list down the steps for us to reproduce the bug, because the easier it is for us to recreate the bug, the faster it is likely to be fixed.

Feature requests
----------------

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Umbrel, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Please search our [issues list](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel/issues) on GitHub and our [community forum](https://community.getumbrel.com). If you can't find an existing feature request, please open a new topic on the [community forum](https://community.getumbrel.com) with your feature request.

Contributing code and documentation changes
-------------------------------------------

If you would like to contribute a new feature or a bugfix, please discuss your idea first on a GitHub issue. If there is no existing GitHub issue for your idea, please open one. There are often a number of ways to fix a problem and it is important to find the right approach before spending time on a PR that cannot be merged. So we request you to only start the work on implementing a feature once you received a green light from one of our maintainers on your idea and its implementation.

We add the [help wanted](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel/labels/help%20wanted) label to existing GitHub issues for which community contributions are particularly welcome, and we use the [good first issue](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel/labels/good%20first%20issue) label to mark issues that we think will be suitable for new contributors.

The process for contributing to any of the [Umbrel repositories](https://github.com/getumbrel/) is similar.
