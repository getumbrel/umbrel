# By default Linux uses the UAS driver for most devices. This causes major

# provide enough power to the USB port and the entire system experiences
# extreme instability. By blacklisting all devices from the UAS driver on boot
# we fall back to the mass-storage driver, which results in decreased
# performance, but lower power usage, and much better system stability.
