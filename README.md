# ‚òÇÔ∏è Umbrel

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Umbrel is currently in beta and is not considered secure. Please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for more details.

This is the master respository of Umbrel and contains the framework for orchestration of all containerized services running on [Umbrel OS](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os).

It is platform and architecture-agnostic, thus can be used to directly spin up instances of Umbrel without installing the [Umbrel OS](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os) since all orchestrated services use multi-architecture Docker images.

We run it on Raspbery Pis (ARMv7) as a part of [Umbrel OS](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os), Ubuntu (x64) for [testnet.getumbrel.com](https://testnet.getumbrel.com) and macOS (x64) for local development.

## üöÄ Getting started

If you're looking to run Umbrel on:

- A Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 (recommended) - [Download Umbrel OS](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os)
- Anything else (experimental) - [Install Umbrel](#-installation)

## üõ† Installation

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)
- [Python 3.0+](https://www.python.org/downloads)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)

Ensure that your account is [correctly permissioned to use docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).

### Step 1. Download

> Run this in an empty directory where you want to install Umbrel

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel/archive/v0.2.2.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components=1
```

### Step 2. Run

```bash
# To use Umbrel on mainnet, run:
sudo ./scripts/start

# For testnet, run:
sudo NETWORK=testnet ./scripts/start

# For regtest, run:
sudo NETWORK=regtest ./scripts/start
```

To stop Umbrel, run:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/stop
```

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Don't be too reckless

> Umbrel is still in early development and things are expected to break every now and then. We **DO NOT** recommend running it on the mainnet with real money just yet, unless you want to be really *#reckless*.
