## Installing Umbrel
> Umbrel is currently in beta and not considered secure. Please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for more details.


The easiest way to get started is by running [Umbrel OS](https://download.umbrel.com/umbrel-os.zip) on a Raspberry Pi 4. Step-by-step installation intructions can be found [here](https://umbrel.com/#start).

Alternatively you can install Umbrel on any Ubuntu or Debian based system with:

```bash
curl -L https://umbrel.sh | bash
```

## Setting up a development environment

With the latest release of Umbrel 0.5, a lot of the underlying architecture of the project has changed. This section will be re-written in the next couple of days with up-to-date development instructions.
