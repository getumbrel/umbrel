At Umbrel, we believe that everyone should be able to enjoy the convenience and benefits of the cloud, without giving up ownership and control of their data.
</p>

<p align="center">
To achieve our vision, we're building a new kind of personal server OS. Instead of paying ransoms for storing your data on someone else's computer while they auction it off to advertisers — you can now easily spin up a server and self-host your data and services at home.
</p>

<p align="center">
Just like the cloud, but one that you own and control.

## Installing umbrelOS
> umbrelOS is currently in beta and should not be considered secure. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for more details.

The easiest way to get started on a custom (non Umbrel Home) system is by running [umbrelOS for Raspberry Pi 4](https://download.umbrel.com/umbrel-os.zip). Step-by-step installation intructions can be found [here](https://umbrel.com/#start).

Alternatively you can install umbrelOS on any Ubuntu or Debian system (both x86 and arm64) with:

```bash
curl -L https://umbrel.sh | bash
```
