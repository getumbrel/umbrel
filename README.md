<p align="center">
At Umbrel, we believe that everyone should be able to enjoy the convenience and benefits of the cloud, without giving up ownership and control of their data.
</p>

<p align="center">
To achieve our vision, we're building a new kind of personal server OS. Instead of paying ransoms for storing your data on someone else's computer while they auction it off to advertisers — you can now easily spin up a server and self-host your data and services at home.
</p>

<p align="center">
Just like the cloud, but one that you own and control.

## Installing umbrelOS

The easiest way to get started on a custom (non Umbrel Home) system is by running [umbrelOS for Raspberry Pi 5](https://download.umbrel.com/release/1.0.0/umbrelos-pi5.img.zip) or [Raspberry Pi 4](https://download.umbrel.com/release/1.0.0/umbrelos-pi4.img.zip). Step-by-step installation instructions can be found [here](https://umbrel.com/umbrelos#install).

### Installing on Debian
