The licensor grants you an additional copyright license

You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of
the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the

beginning with `Required Notice:` that the licensor provided
with the software.  For example:

## Changes and New Works License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to
make changes and new works based on the software for any

## Noncommercial Purposes

Any noncommercial purpose is a permitted purpose.

## Personal Uses

Personal use for research, experiment, and testing for

is use for a permitted purpose.

## Noncommercial Organizations

## Fair Use

You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the
law. These terms do not limit them.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply
any other licenses.

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If
your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends
immediately for work on behalf of your company.

## Violations

The first time you are notified in writing that you have
violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software
not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless
continue if you come into full compliance with these terms,
and take practical steps to correct past violations, within
32 days of receiving notice.  Otherwise, all your licenses
end immediately.
