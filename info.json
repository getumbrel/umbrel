    "requires": ">=0.2.1",
    "notes": "This version of Umbrel brings LND 0.13.4 and updated apps (BTCPay Server, Specter Desktop, Pi-hole, Lightning Terminal, and more) to the Umbrel App Store.\n\nLND 0.13.4 fixes a bug discovered in the previous version which will break Neutrino functionality after the Taproot activation in ~3 days. Because Neutrino is only used when Bitcoin Core is still syncing, in short: if Bitcoin Core on your Umbrel hasn't finished syncing, please update immediately. If Bitcoin Core on your Umbrel is 100% synced already, you remain unaffected by this bug and can update at your convenience.\n\nIf you face any difficulties while updating, please message us on Telegram: https://t.me/getumbrel"
