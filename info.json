    "notes": "Knock knock! Who’s there? Wallets! Wallets who? Electrum, Blockstream Green, BlueWallet, Phoenix, Sparrow, Wasabi, Zap, and Zeus! You can now connect your favorite wallets directly to your Umbrel. Due to performance constraints of running an Electrum server, this update isn’t compatible with devices with less than 2GB RAM, such as Raspberry Pi 3 and we strongly recommend upgrading to a device with a larger RAM size, such as the Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB or 8GB RAM.
